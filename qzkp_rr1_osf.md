1. Main Question and Importance
Main Question: How can Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proof (Quantum-ZKP) protocols, inspired by quantum mechanics principles, improve security, scalability, and fault tolerance in distributed systems? Importance: The research addresses critical needs in secure computing, particularly for decentralized environments like blockchain and distributed consensus systems. Answering this will advance both theoretical cryptography and practical applications by integrating quantum principles in classical systems, making them robust against future quantum-based threats.

2. Key Variables
Independent Variables (IV):
Quantum-inspired protocol settings (e.g., types of probabilistic encoding and logical entanglement).
System characteristics (e.g., distributed network reliability, varying levels of adversarial nodes).
Dependent Variables (DV):
Verification Success Rate: Measured as the percentage of successful proofs under different protocol settings.
Fault Tolerance: Quantified as the maximum level of node failure (or malicious actors) that the protocol can withstand while maintaining correct output.
Scalability: Assessed by proof generation and verification times under different network sizes and conditions.
3. Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Quantum-inspired ZKP protocols improve Verification Success Rate compared to classical ZKP in adversarial conditions.
Null Hypothesis (H0): Quantum-inspired ZKP does not significantly improve verification success rate.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Quantum-ZKP enhances Fault Tolerance by maintaining system integrity at higher adversarial node counts than classical ZKP.
H0: There is no difference in fault tolerance between Quantum-ZKP and classical ZKP.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Quantum-ZKP improves Scalability by reducing proof generation and verification times in larger networks.
H0: Quantum-ZKP does not differ in scalability from classical ZKP.
4. Conditions and Design
Conditions: The study will simulate a between-subjects design with multiple conditions reflecting various protocol settings. We will vary:
Probabilistic Encoding Type: Classical vs. quantum-inspired.
Network Adversarial Level: Low, medium, and high levels of malicious nodes.
System Load: Varying sizes and configurations of the network.
Randomization: Network nodes and adversarial positions will be randomly assigned to reduce bias.
Blinding: Researchers conducting verification tests will not know the specifics of encoding to ensure unbiased outcome assessment.
5. Observations and Stopping Rule
Observations: A minimum of 500 test cases will be simulated per condition to achieve a target power of 0.80, based on preliminary effect sizes.
Stopping Rule: Data collection will stop upon reaching the sample size or if no additional observations meaningfully affect the estimated effect size. We aim to detect a minimum effect size of 0.25 for performance measures.
Statistical Framework: Frequentist NHST with planned use of Bayesian inference to validate effects under smaller sample sizes.
6. Study Inclusion Criteria
Simulation Criteria: Only network configurations that meet minimum operational stability (e.g., reliable packet transmission, defined node interaction protocols) will be included.
Sample Criteria: Samples will be included based on specific network properties (e.g., degree of connectivity, redundancy levels).
7. Data Exclusion Criteria
Exclusion at Simulation Level: Simulations will be excluded if they exhibit network failure due to errors unrelated to protocol effectiveness (e.g., hardware constraints, abnormal latencies).
Exclusion at Observation Level: Observations with incomplete proof verification or corrupted data due to non-experimental factors (e.g., simulation failure) will be removed.
8. Positive Controls and Quality Checks
Positive Control: A baseline test using classical ZKP in the same configurations will verify that our protocols correctly detect malicious nodes and handle fault tolerance. This ensures that any differences are due to the quantum-inspired adjustments.
Quality Checks:
Noise limits will be applied to prevent extreme outliers in latency or verification times.
Checks for floor/ceiling effects will be implemented for fault tolerance and success rate metrics.
9. Analysis Plan
Hypothesis Testing: Each hypothesis will be tested with an ANOVA for differences in success rates, fault tolerance, and scalability.
Post-hoc Tests: In cases of significant ANOVA results, post-hoc comparisons between classical and quantum-inspired settings will be conducted.
Bayesian Analysis: To assess the robustness of our results, we will employ Bayesian hypothesis testing to confirm effect size and strength of evidence.
Contingency Plan: If data show non-normality, we will apply non-parametric tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U tests). If results do not show statistical significance, we will interpret them as "no evidence of a difference," unless Bayesian analysis indicates strong support for the null hypothesis.
10. Data Collection Plan
New Data: We will generate new data through simulated experiments tailored to test Quantum-ZKP under controlled conditions. No existing data will be used.
Avoiding Bias: All analyses will be pre-registered to avoid bias. Pilot testing will inform parameters for the final simulations without influencing outcome expectations.
